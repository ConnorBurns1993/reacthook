        I enjoy building quality applications and I am learning more about
        software development everyday. I aspire to be a better software
        developer tomorrow than I am today, so I consider myself a constant
        student. I would love if you would reach out to me if you have any
        questions or just want to talk about software development in general.
        Please see the links below for ways to reach me and thank you again for
        visiting my site!
